The code for the CNN can be found in 'project_code/ideepcolor' and the code for features matching step is in 'project_code/colorization'.
Note that we don't use the code in 'project_code/zheng_colorization' as it is just for exploration purpose.

Please see 'project_code/ideepcolor/results' for some colorized video results. The videos are named 'features_x.mp4', which are recolorized versions of
videos from the dataset in 'project_code/ideepcolor/YUP++'. A video colorized by vanilla CNN network for image is also shown there, namely "vanilla.mp4".
